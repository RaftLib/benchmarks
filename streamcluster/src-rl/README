RaftLib StreamCluster Implementation

To build with tests, do the following:

1. Make a new directory (i.e. `mkdir build`) within any folder you would like. This is easier if you do it within the src-rl directory.
2. Enter that directory (`cd build`)
3. Run `cmake` from within the directory targeting the src-rl directory (optionally add flag -DMULTI_TESTS for multi-threaded test versions and/or -DNATIVE_TESTS for native data input tests).
4. Run `make && make test`
