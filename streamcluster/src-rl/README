RaftLib StreamCluster Implementation
====================================

To build with tests, do the following:

1. Make a new directory (i.e. `mkdir build`) within the src-rl folder. Placing this somewhere else will cause the tests to fail due to relative paths.
2. Enter that directory (`cd build`)
3. Run `cmake ..` (optionally add flag -DMULTI_TESTS for multi-threaded test versions and/or -DNATIVE_TESTS for native data input tests).
4. Run `make && make test`

Otherwise, you may build in any directory and the streamcluster binary that is generated will work.
