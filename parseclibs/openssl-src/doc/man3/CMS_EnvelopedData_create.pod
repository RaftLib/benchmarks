=head1 NAME

CMS_EnvelopedData_create - Create CMS envelope

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/cms.h>

 CMS_ContentInfo *CMS_EnvelopedData_create(const EVP_CIPHER *cipher);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

CMS_EnvelopedData_create() creates a B<CMS_ContentInfo> structure with
a type B<NID_pkcs7_enveloped>. B<cipher> is the symmetric cipher to use.

The algorithm passed in the B<cipher> parameter must support ASN1 encoding of
its parameters.

The recipients can be added later using L<CMS_add1_recipient_cert(3)> or
L<CMS_add0_recipient_key(3)>.

The B<CMS_ContentInfo> structure needs to be finalized using L<CMS_final(3)>
and then freed using L<CMS_ContentInfo_free(3)>.

=head1 NOTES

Although CMS_EnvelopedData_create() allocates a new B<CMS_ContentInfo>
structure it is usually not used in applications. The wrappers
L<CMS_encrypt(3)> and L<CMS_decrypt(3)> are often used instead.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

If the allocation fails, CMS_EnvelopedData_create() returns NULL and sets
an error code that can be obtained by L<ERR_get_error(3)>.
Otherwise it returns a pointer to the newly allocated structure.
