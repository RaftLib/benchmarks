=head1 NAME

X509v3_cache_extensions
- cache info on various X.509v3 extensions and further derived certificate data

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/x509v3.h>

 int X509v3_cache_extensions(X509 *x, OPENSSL_CTX *libctx, const char *propq);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This function processes any X509v3 extensions that might be present in an X509
object and caches the result of that processing as well as further derived info,
for instance if the certificate is self-issued. Many OpenSSL functions that use
an X509 object will cause extensions to be processed and cached implicitly. If
this is done implicitly then the default library context and property query
string will be used. In some cases it may be desirable to use some other library
context and property query string. If so then an application can call
X509v3_cache_extensions() explicitly. This should be done before any function
that needs to use those extensions is called - otherwise calling
X509v3_cache_extensions() will have no effect. Typically this means calling this
soon after creation of the X509 object. The X509 object to be processed is
given in I<x> and the library context and property query string to use are given
in I<libctx> and I<propq>.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

This function returns 0 if the extensions are invalid or an error occurred.
Otherwise it returns 1.
