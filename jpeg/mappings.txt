MAPPING 1: //everything on one processor
   Everything on one processor
Mapping 2: //four processors
   GenColor //One Process
   Y'CbCr //One Process
   all JPEG pipelines //One Process
   FileWrite //One Process
Mapping 3: //Six Processors
   Gen Color //One Process
   Y'CbCr //One Proces
   Each JPEG Pipeline //One Process so 3 Processes total
   FileWrite //One Process
Mapping 4: //12 Processors
   GenColor //One Process
   Y'CbCr //One Process
   //Each of these will have one replication for each channel
   {LevelShift,DCT2Array} //One process for each pipeline = 3 processes
   {Quant,Dcc,Zigzag} //One process for each = 3 processes
   {huff } One process for each = 3 processes
   FileWrite = 1 process

   //for each of these make sure you specify a unique cpunum so they'll each have their own processor.
